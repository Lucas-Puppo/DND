        <h2>How the Download Works</h2>
        <p>This download link takes you directly to the files hosted on GitHub. When you click it, your browser will start downloading it automatically.</p>
		<p><b>HOWEVER</b>, when you open the file it will immediately prompt you saying windows protected your pc. This is known as a false negitive (something that is not bad, but flagged for protection.)</p>
		<p> So just press more details. Then run anyway. Me and Woberwinne already have it installed and I have verified that it is not a virus. Moslty... :3</p>
